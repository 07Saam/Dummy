            <h5>TEAM</h5>
            <p>I’m Manaour, a first-semester Information Science student at CMRIT, Bangalore, and together with my teammate Manish, we’ve created a travel blog tailored for students like us. Our goal is to make travel easier, more affordable, and enjoyable for students by sharing insightful tips, guides, and destinations. With a blend of creativity and technical skills, we’ve developed this project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, aiming to inspire our peers to explore the world without breaking the bank.</p>
