            <h2>How to Pack Light: Tips for Student Travelers</h2>
            <p>Packing light is the key to stress-free travel. Start by choosing versatile clothing items that can be mixed and matched for various outfits. Stick to a carry-on to avoid the hassle of checking luggage and waiting at baggage claim. Opt for lightweight, wrinkle-resistant fabrics that can be layered for different weather conditions. Minimize your toiletries by carrying travel-sized essentials, and skip unnecessary gadgets or items you’re unlikely to use. Instead, focus on essentials like a good pair of walking shoes and a reusable water bottle. Remember, you can always buy small necessities at your destination, saving you both space and stress.</p>
